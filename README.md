# Endless-Unciv-Ruleset
*WIP* Overhaul mod for Unciv. Select "Spectator" for mechanic explanation. Pairs with "Echoes of Auriga for Unciv" mod.

## This is an early alpha
Lots of images missing. Some will be extracted from Endless Legend.

Faction balance is in shambles due to mechanic changes, some faction specific stuff is missing.

Tech tree past 2nd era is empty. Few techs will have changes.

Policy trees are incomplete.

Unit cost & balance will need an overhaul.

Use for strategic resources by adding them to building requirements.
